<h2 id='getting_help'>Getting Help</h2>

<p>If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ git help &lt;verb&gt;
$ git &lt;verb&gt; --help
$ man git-&lt;verb&gt;</code></pre>

<p>For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running</p>

<pre><code>$ git help config</code></pre>

<p>These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline. If the manpages and this book aren’t enough and you need in-person help, you can try the <code>#git</code> or <code>#github</code> channel on the Freenode IRC server (irc.freenode.net). These channels are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgeable about Git and are often willing to help.</p>
