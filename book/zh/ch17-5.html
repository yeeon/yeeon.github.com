<h2 id='remote'>远程(Remote)分支</h2>

<p>Remote branches are references to the state of branches on your remote repositories. They’re local branches that you can’t move; they’re moved automatically whenever you do any network communication. Remote branches act as bookmarks to remind you where the branches on your remote repositories were the last time you connected to them.</p>

<p>They take the form <code>(remote)/(branch)</code>. For instance, if you wanted to see what the <code>master</code> branch on your <code>origin</code> remote looked like as of the last time you communicated with it, you would check the <code>origin/master</code> branch. If you were working on an issue with a partner and they pushed up an <code>iss53</code> branch, you might have your own local <code>iss53</code> branch; but the branch on the server would point to the commit at <code>origin/iss53</code>.</p>

<p>This may be a bit confusing, so let’s look at an example. Let’s say you have a Git server on your network at <code>git.ourcompany.com</code>. If you clone from this, Git automatically names it <code>origin</code> for you, pulls down all its data, creates a pointer to where its <code>master</code> branch is, and names it <code>origin/master</code> locally; and you can’t move it. Git also gives you your own <code>master</code> branch starting at the same place as origin’s <code>master</code> branch, so you have something to work from (见图 3-22).</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0322-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-22. A Git clone gives you your own master branch and origin/master pointing to origin’s master branch.</p>

<p>If you do some work on your local master branch, and, in the meantime, someone else pushes to <code>git.ourcompany.com</code> and updates its master branch, then your histories move forward differently. Also, as long as you stay out of contact with your origin server, your <code>origin/master</code> pointer doesn’t move (见图 3-23).</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0323-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-23. Working locally and having someone push to your remote server makes each history move forward differently.</p>

<p>To synchronize your work, you run a <code>git fetch origin</code> command. This command looks up which server origin is (in this case, it’s <code>git.ourcompany.com</code>), fetches any data from it that you don’t yet have, and updates your local database, moving your <code>origin/master</code> pointer to its new, more up-to-date position (见图 3-24).</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0324-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-24. The git fetch command updates your remote references.</p>

<p>To demonstrate having multiple remote servers and what remote branches for those remote projects look like, let’s assume you have another internal Git server that is used only for development by one of your sprint teams. This server is at <code>git.team1.ourcompany.com</code>. You can add it as a new remote reference to the project you’re currently working on by running the <code>git remote add</code> command as we covered in Chapter 2. Name this remote <code>teamone</code>, which will be your shortname for that whole URL (见图 3-25).</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0325-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-25. Adding another server as a remote</p>

<p>Now, you can run <code>git fetch teamone</code> to fetch everything server has that you don’t have yet. Because that server is a subset of the data your <code>origin</code> server has right now, Git fetches no data but sets a remote branch called <code>teamone/master</code> to point to the commit that <code>teamone</code> has as its <code>master</code> branch (见图 3-26).</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0326-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-26. You get a reference to teamone’s master branch position locally.</p>

<h3 id='pushing'>推送(pushing)</h3>

<p>When you want to share a branch with the world, you need to push it up to a remote that you have write access to. Your local branches aren’t automatically synchronized to the remotes you write to — you have to explicitly push the branches you want to share. That way, you can use private branches for work you don’t want to share, and push up only the topic branches you want to collaborate on.</p>

<p>If you have a branch named <code>serverfix</code> that you want to work on with others, you can push it up the same way you pushed your first branch. Run <code>git push (remote) (branch)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin serverfix
Counting objects: 20, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.
Writing objects: 100% (15/15), 1.74 KiB, done.
Total 15 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
 * [new branch]      serverfix -&gt; serverfix</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit of a shortcut. Git automatically expands the <code>serverfix</code> branchname out to <code>refs/heads/serverfix:refs/heads/serverfix</code>, which means, “Take my serverfix local branch and push it to update the remote’s serverfix branch.” We’ll go over the <code>refs/heads/</code> part in detail in Chapter 9, but you can generally leave it off. You can also do <code>git push origin serverfix:serverfix</code>, which does the same thing — it says, “Take my serverfix and make it the remote’s serverfix.” You can use this format to push a local branch into a remote branch that is named differently. If you didn’t want it to be called <code>serverfix</code> on the remote, you could instead run <code>git push origin serverfix:awesomebranch</code> to push your local <code>serverfix</code> branch to the <code>awesomebranch</code> branch on the remote project.</p>

<p>The next time one of your collaborators fetches from the server, they will get a reference to where the server’s version of <code>serverfix</code> is under the remote branch <code>origin/serverfix</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch origin
remote: Counting objects: 20, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.
remote: Total 15 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (15/15), done.
From git@github.com:schacon/simplegit
 * [new branch]      serverfix    -&gt; origin/serverfix</code></pre>

<p>It’s important to note that when you do a fetch that brings down new remote branches, you don’t automatically have local, editable copies of them. In other words, in this case, you don’t have a new <code>serverfix</code> branch — you only have an <code>origin/serverfix</code> pointer that you can’t modify.</p>

<p>To merge this work into your current working branch, you can run <code>git merge origin/serverfix</code>. If you want your own <code>serverfix</code> branch that you can work on, you can base it off your remote branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b serverfix origin/serverfix
Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/serverfix.
Switched to a new branch &quot;serverfix&quot;</code></pre>

<p>This gives you a local branch that you can work on that starts where <code>origin/serverfix</code> is.</p>

<h3 id='tracking'>跟踪(tracking)分支</h3>

<p>Checking out a local branch from a remote branch automatically creates what is called a <em>tracking branch</em>. Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch. If you’re on a tracking branch and type git push, Git automatically knows which server and branch to push to. Also, running <code>git pull</code> while on one of these branches fetches all the remote references and then automatically merges in the corresponding remote branch.</p>

<p>When you clone a repository, it generally automatically creates a <code>master</code> branch that tracks <code>origin/master</code>. That’s why <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> work out of the box with no other arguments. However, you can set up other tracking branches if you wish — ones that don’t track branches on <code>origin</code> and don’t track the <code>master</code> branch. The simple case is the example you just saw, running <code>git checkout -b [branch] [remotename]/[branch]</code>. If you have Git version 1.6.2 or later, you can also use the <code>--track</code> shorthand:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout --track origin/serverfix
Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/serverfix.
Switched to a new branch &quot;serverfix&quot;</code></pre>

<p>To set up a local branch with a different name than the remote branch, you can easily use the first version with a different local branch name:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b sf origin/serverfix
Branch sf set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/serverfix.
Switched to a new branch &quot;sf&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Now, your local branch sf will automatically push to and pull from origin/serverfix.</p>

<h3 id='id30'>删除远程分支</h3>

<p>Suppose you’re done with a remote branch — say, you and your collaborators are finished with a feature and have merged it into your remote’s <code>master</code> branch (or whatever branch your stable codeline is in). You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax <code>git push [remotename] :[branch]</code>. If you want to delete your <code>serverfix</code> branch from the server, you run the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin :serverfix
To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
 - [deleted]         serverfix</code></pre>

<p>Boom. No more branch on your server. You may want to dog-ear this page, because you’ll need that command, and you’ll likely forget the syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the <code>git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch]</code> syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the <code>[localbranch]</code> portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be <code>[remotebranch]</code>.”</p>

<p>In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: the <code>merge</code> and the <code>rebase</code>. In this section you’ll learn what rebasing is, how to do it, why it’s a pretty amazing tool, and in what cases you won’t want to use it.</p>

<h3 id='rebasing'>衍合(rebasing)基础</h3>

<p>If you go back to an earlier example from the Merge section (见图 3-27), you can see that you diverged your work and made commits on two different branches.</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0327-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-27. Your initial diverged commit history</p>

<p>The easiest way to integrate the branches, as we’ve already covered, is the <code>merge</code> command. It performs a three-way merge between the two latest branch snapshots (C3 and C4) and the most recent common ancestor of the two (C2), creating a new snapshot (and commit), as shown in 图 3-28.</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0328-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-28. Merging a branch to integrate the diverged work history</p>

<p>However, there is another way: you can take the patch of the change that was introduced in C3 and reapply it on top of C4. In Git, this is called <em>rebasing</em>. With the <code>rebase</code> command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on another one.</p>

<p>In this example, you’d run the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout experiment
$ git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: added staged command</code></pre>

<p>It works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you’re on and the one you’re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you’re on, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn. 图 3-29 illustrates this process.</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0329-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-29. Rebasing the change introduced in C3 onto C4</p>

<p>At this point, you can go back to the master branch and do a fast-forward merge (见图 3-30).</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0330-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-30. Fast-forwarding the master branch</p>

<p>Now, the snapshot pointed to by C3 is exactly the same as the one that was pointed to by C5 in the merge example. There is no difference in the end product of the integration, but rebasing makes for a cleaner history. If you examine the log of a rebased branch, it looks like a linear history: it appears that all the work happened in series, even when it originally happened in parallel.</p>

<p>Often, you’ll do this to make sure your commits apply cleanly on a remote branch — perhaps in a project to which you’re trying to contribute but that you don’t maintain. In this case, you’d do your work in a branch and then rebase your work onto <code>origin/master</code> when you were ready to submit your patches to the main project. That way, the maintainer doesn’t have to do any integration work — just a fast-forward or a clean apply.</p>

<p>Note that the snapshot pointed to by the final commit you end up with, whether it’s the last of the rebased commits for a rebase or the final merge commit after a merge, is the same snapshot — it’s only the history that is different. Rebasing replays changes from one line of work onto another in the order they were introduced, whereas merging takes the endpoints and merges them together.</p>

<h3 id='id31'>更多有趣的衍合</h3>

<p>You can also have your rebase replay on something other than the rebase branch. Take a history like 图 3-31, for example. You branched a topic branch (<code>server</code>) to add some server-side functionality to your project, and made a commit. Then, you branched off that to make the client-side changes (<code>client</code>) and committed a few times. Finally, you went back to your server branch and did a few more commits.</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0331-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-31. A history with a topic branch off another topic branch</p>

<p>Suppose you decide that you want to merge your client-side changes into your mainline for a release, but you want to hold off on the server-side changes until it’s tested further. You can take the changes on client that aren’t on server (C8 and C9) and replay them on your master branch by using the <code>--onto</code> option of <code>git rebase</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git rebase --onto master server client</code></pre>

<p>This basically says, “Check out the client branch, figure out the patches from the common ancestor of the <code>client</code> and <code>server</code> branches, and then replay them onto <code>master</code>.” It’s a bit complex; but the result, shown in Figure 3-32, is pretty cool.</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0332-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-32. Rebasing a topic branch off another topic branch</p>

<p>Now you can fast-forward your master branch (见图 3-33):</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git merge client</code></pre>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0333-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-33. Fast-forwarding your master branch to include the client branch changes</p>

<p>Let’s say you decide to pull in your server branch as well. You can rebase the server branch onto the master branch without having to check it out first by running <code>git rebase [basebranch] [topicbranch]</code> — which checks out the topic branch (in this case, <code>server</code>) for you and replays it onto the base branch (<code>master</code>):</p>

<pre><code>$ git rebase master server</code></pre>

<p>This replays your <code>server</code> work on top of your <code>master</code> work, as shown in Figure 3-34.</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0334-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-34. Rebasing your server branch on top of your master branch</p>

<p>Then, you can fast-forward the base branch (<code>master</code>):</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git merge server</code></pre>

<p>You can remove the <code>client</code> and <code>server</code> branches because all the work is integrated and you don’t need them anymore, leaving your history for this entire process looking like Figure 3-35:</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch -d client
$ git branch -d server</code></pre>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0335-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-35. Final commit history</p>

<h3 id='id32'>衍合的风险</h3>

<p>Ahh, but the bliss of rebasing isn’t without its drawbacks, which can be summed up in a single line:</p>

<p><strong>Do not rebase commits that you have pushed to a public repository.</strong></p>

<p>If you follow that guideline, you’ll be fine. If you don’t, people will hate you, and you’ll be scorned by friends and family.</p>

<p>When you rebase stuff, you’re abandoning existing commits and creating new ones that are similar but different. If you push commits somewhere and others pull them down and base work on them, and then you rewrite those commits with <code>git rebase</code> and push them up again, your collaborators will have to re-merge their work and things will get messy when you try to pull their work back into yours.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example of how rebasing work that you’ve made public can cause problems. Suppose you clone from a central server and then do some work off that. Your commit history looks like Figure 3-36.</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0336-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-36. Clone a repository, and base some work on it.</p>

<p>Now, someone else does more work that includes a merge, and pushes that work to the central server. You fetch them and merge the new remote branch into your work, making your history look something like Figure 3-37.</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0337-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-37. Fetch more commits, and merge them into your work.</p>

<p>Next, the person who pushed the merged work decides to go back and rebase their work instead; they do a <code>git push --force</code> to overwrite the history on the server. You then fetch from that server, bringing down the new commits.</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0338-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-38. Someone pushes rebased commits, abandoning commits you’ve based your work on.</p>

<p>At this point, you have to merge this work in again, even though you’ve already done so. Rebasing changes the SHA-1 hashes of these commits so to Git they look like new commits, when in fact you already have the C4 work in your history (见图 Figure 3-39).</p>

<p><center><img src="/figures/ch17/18333fig0339-tn.png"></center><br/> 图 3-39. You merge in the same work again into a new merge commit.</p>

<p>You have to merge that work in at some point so you can keep up with the other developer in the future. After you do that, your commit history will contain both the C4 and C4&#8217; commits, which have different SHA-1 hashes but introduce the same work and have the same commit message. If you run a <code>git log</code> when your history looks like this, you’ll see two commits that have the same author date and message, which will be confusing. Furthermore, if you push this history back up to the server, you’ll reintroduce all those rebased commits to the central server, which can further confuse people.</p>

<p>If you treat rebasing as a way to clean up and work with commits before you push them, and if you only rebase commits that have never been available publicly, then you’ll be fine. If you rebase commits that have already been pushed publicly, and people may have based work on those commits, then you may be in for some frustrating trouble.</p>
