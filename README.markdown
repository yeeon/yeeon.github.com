Pro Git Book
==================

This is the Jekyll source for the Pro Git book website, the online edition of the Pro Git Book published by Apress.  This is not the source for the book content itself, this is just the framework for publishing it online via GitHub Pages.

The design is based on the awesome Michael Bleigh's blog and website, [Mister Bleigh](http://www.mbleigh.com/), and he gets full credit for everything that is good looking or impressive about this site.

The content of the site (book content, blog posts and page content) is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike 3.0 license (you may use it, but only under the same license and you must give attribution).
